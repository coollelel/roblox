    <h1>ABOUT US!</h1>
    <p>We are a user-generated website that had been made with VERCEL and GitHub.</p>
    <p>We used GitHub to create a repository, then we created some folders (rbxcdn/CDN, home, login, CreateAccount) and we used .html (specifically index.html) so you didn't need to add "whatever".html at the end of the url and could just normally end it at the url's ending / or at the url directory's ending /. We used Chrome's View Source right click menu feature and Inspect Element right click menu feature to get the page's source and import it to our website's webpages. Yeah, that's all.</p>
