    <h1>ABOUT US!</h1>
    <p>We are a user-generated website that had been made with VERCEL and GitHub.</p>
    <p>We used GitHub to create a repository, then we created some folders (rbxcdn/CDN, home, login, CreateAccount) and we used .html (specifically index.html) so you didn't need to add "whatever".html at the end of the url and could just normally end it at the url's ending / or at the url directory's ending /. We used Chrome's View Source right click menu feature and Inspect Element right click menu feature to get the page's source and import it to our website's webpages. We used Vercel's import git repos tool to import the GitHub Repository and make it a website. Vercel is currently the only way I can make websites and have people see them, so yeah. Thanks for reading this. That's all.</p>
