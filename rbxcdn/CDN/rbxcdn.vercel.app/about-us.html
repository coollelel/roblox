    <h2>ABOUT US!</h2>
    <p>We are a user-generated website that had been made with VERCEL and GitHub.</p>
    <p>We are mainly a trick for people who literally can't find the actual website that they're looking for and end up in an completely different type of wensite (ex: phishing website that asks for password and email/username like this one does but using fake ROBLOX webpages using Chrome's VIEW SOURCE right-click menu option.)</p>
    <p>We are hosted by kutz (k_utz on discord, email is kurt3daybann@gmail.com)</p>
    <p>OUR REPOSITORY IS </p>
